    The \ISA instruction set architecture being one of the
    most complex and widely used ISAs,  ensuring the correctness of the x86-64 binary code is
    important. One of the strongest ways to ensure that is to define a  formal semantics of the \ISA language. We present ongoing work in augmenting the capability of an existing \ISA formal semantics, with the most complete user-level instruction support, by formalizing the instruction decoder and thereby allowing direct analysis of binary code.
     %Completely formalizing

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
x86-64 being one of the most complex ISAs and widely used in servers and
desktop, ensuring the correctness of the program written in binary is extremely
important. A formal semantics of x86-64 is imperative for formal reasoning
about binary code, which is  one of the strongest ways to ensure
correctness. A formal semantics of the ISA allows direct reasoning about the
binary code, which is desirable, not only because it allows to analyze the
binary even when the source code is not available (e.g., legacy code or
    malware), but also because it avoids the need to trust the correctness of
compilers.

%preferred over source level analysis in scenarioes like legacy software with
%missing source code or maware analysis.  at times more desirable than the
%source level analysis. For example, in case of legacy software, when the
%source code is missing, or malware analysis.  Also, often times it is not
%desirable to add the compiler in the trusted base due to presence of compiler
%bugs or some aggressive optimization that compiler does in the presence of
%undefined behaviour. As a result, there might not be any guarantee that the
%analysis results that we gather at the source level  can be applied faithfully
%to the binary code.  
%

Completely formalizing the semantics of the \ISA ISA, however, is extremely
challenging especially due to the complexity and the large number of
instructions that are informally specified in the reference manual~\cite{IntelManual}.
%, using a mixture of prose and pseudocode, in thousands of pages in the
%\emph{Intel reference manual}.  %
Despite the challenges, we witnessed the heroic effort~\cite{Dasgupta:2019} in
formalizing the semantics of most of the user-level instructions using the language
semantics engineering framework \K. However, the developed semantics is for the
assembly language notation of the binary program and hence limited in the sense
that any binary analysis using that formalism requires, as a prerequisite,
     converting the binary to the supported mnemonic notation using an
     off-the-shelf disassembler. Such a requirement includes the disassembler in
     the trusted computing base. Through the present work, we eliminate the
     limitation by formally specifying an instruction decoder and thereby
     allowing~\cite{Dasgupta:2019} to work directly on binary code. Also, our work is publicly available~\cite{x86-64-decoder-github}.
